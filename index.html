    <h2 id="approach">Cutting through complexity</h2>

    <p>If you are here, it's likely your IT organization isn't operating at exceptional levels.</p>
    <p>Do you have an IT product or service that you are struggling to take to market? Perhaps you are in a situation where releases are consistently late or disconnected from business needs and the morale of IT staff is low? Perhaps the organization needs to grow and mature so more products or services are released, but adding staff seems to <i>reduce</i> productivity? Another common situation with IT is key energetic figures that held the organization together when it was smaller are either gone or overtaxed with the organization's current size and scope. Perhaps you simply seek experienced consultation in IT Management, Architecture, Development, Security, or Performance.</p>
    <p>These are the types of situations that truly test an organization and it can be a great help to have someone on-hand who understands the reality and complexity of IT. Robert's approach is holis­tic pro­vid­ing at­ten­tion where it is needed most to improve results whether it is management, strategy, marketing, innovation, or process optimization.</p>
    <p>Whether you are looking for a consultation over Skype, a 1-week assessement of your IT environment, or a 6-month transformation of an IT project or organization, <a href="#contact">contact</a> Avniel Consulting to discuss a potential engagement.</p>

    <h2 id="meet">Meet Robert</h2>
    <p><img id="guidance-friendship" src="img/guidance-friendship.png">Robert Ross Pe­ter­son earned his stripes at IBM where as a highly specialized enterprise consultant, he spent time with IBM's finest leadership including former CEO and Chairman, Sam Palmisano. With a reputation as an IT Red Adair, he has consulted for numerous market leading companies and government agencies internationally. If you bank with a major financial institution in the US or Europe it is more likely than not, that he's conducted business with them either to advise on highly complex integration problems, to strengthen relationships, or to showcase cutting-edge technology.</p>
    <p>He has experience in operations of industrial-grade five nine high availablility IT environments, successful shipping of large releases, and expanding market share using IT innovation coupled with rapid prototyping.</p>
    <p>Robert holds a MS in Computer Engineering &amp; MS in Meditation, has 58 technology patents, and has authored several IT books.</p>

    <h2 id="testimonials">Testimonials</h2>
    <p><i>Robert operates with heart and mind. He listens with care to include and incorporate others' perspectives and capabilities. He aims to create win-win solutions so that all have buy-in, creating powerful outcomes. This care and skill greatly complements his evident intellect and creative ingenuity. &mdash; Megan White, Nonprofit CEO</i></p>
    <p><i>Robert brings a breadth of skills to his clients. He excels at helping them chart a path to their desired outcome and understand the technology tradeoffs for achieving those goals. He can readily map the solution to a broad technology base to ensure clients are building an optimal solution. He is also technically hands on and can quickly prove out concepts with rapid prototyping. I highly recommend him to teams that look to be more agile or transform their technology infrastructure. &mdash; M. Gilfix, IBM Vice President</i></p>
    <p><i>Robert Peterson is an uncommon kind of leader: both devotional and rational. He is as devoted to the beauty of a solution as he is to its efficacy. He is among a rare group of exceptional consultants and researchers where he has distinguished himself through his patents, books and applications. What’s even more valuable than his accomplishments, in my view, is his rapid grasp of complexity, his total engagement, and his gracious leadership through difficulties. You will enjoy both the process and the result of working with Robert. &mdash; P.B., University Chancellor</i></p>
    <p><i>Robert was influential in being a change agent here at HHSC and a big reason how and why our maturity with managing not just the Middlware layer but the greater HHSC data center has vastly improved. &mdash; Alberto Saenz, Healthcare Team Leader</i></p>
    <p><i>I had the pleasure of working with Robert in IBM Lab Services where he was one our stars. Robert joined me later to start Parseix, where he helped define the user interface of a MaaS (Monitoring as a Service) cloud application. He will be a valuable asset for any company. &mdash; Shahryar Sedghi, Startup Founder</i></p>
